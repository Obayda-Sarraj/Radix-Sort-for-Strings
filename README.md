## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a **Radix Sort algorithm** for sorting **strings** using a **Doubly Linked List** in C.  
It supports various operations like:

- Loading data from a text file (`input.txt`)
- Sorting the data using Radix Sort
- Adding or deleting words
- Saving the sorted list to an output file (`output.txt`)
- Menu-based user interface

---

## 🧠 Data Structure Used

- **Doubly Linked List** to store and manage words
- 63-bucket array of lists for radix sorting:
- Spaces, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase characters are all handled separately.

## 📂 File Structure

- `main.c` → Main logic and functions
- `input.txt` → Input file with strings to sort
- `output.txt` → Output file after sorting (created automatically)
- `README.md` → This file
